  - title: Our Proposal
    body: We will send you a proposal within 5 business days detailing the
      viability, timeline, and costs of the website. Most Non-Profit projects
      come at no cost; however, some requests in your design may be more
      difficult than they seem and we will tell you in detail what may and may
      not be recommended. We also may ask for more pictures and text for the
      website.

  - title: Design Agreement
    body: We may spend some time with you via phone or video call to discuss your
      website. When our discussions are complete and you are satisfied with our
      proposal, we will agree to a project and begin the design and the
      construction of the website.

  - title: Design and Development
    body: The time needed to complete the website will vary based on your requests
      as well as our project backlog. We try to help as many non-profit
      organizations as possible with as high of quality as we possible can. Most
      projects can be completed within 1 week to 1 month. We treat non-profit
      projects as first come first serve, so no other project will ever be put
      in front of your project.

  - title: Presentation and Completion
    body: When we complete the website, we will send you a link to a preview of the
      website that no one else can see. We give some time to check for any
      changes you might want to add or remove. When you are satisfied with the
      website we will send it live for the whole world to see.
