  - title: Our Proposal
    body: We will send you a proposal within 5 business days detailing the
      viability, timeline, and costs of the website. Some requests in your
      design may be more difficult than they seem and we will tell you in detail
      what may and may not be recommended. Features such e-commerce and live
      chat may add to the cost. We also may ask for more pictures and text for
      the website.

  - body: We may spend some time with you via phone or video call to discuss your
      website. When our discussions are complete and you are satisfied with our
      proposal, we will agree to a project and begin the design and the
      construction of the website.

  - title: Design and Development
    body: Websites for Small Business are given priority over our non-profit
      projects. Most website will be completed within 1 week to 1 month. The
      time needed to complete the website will vary based on your requests as
      well as our project backlog. Every website we make comes at the highest of
      quality and we believe that good design is more important than fast
      design.

  - title: Presentation and Completion
    body: When we complete the website, we will send you a link to a preview of the
      website that no one else can see. We give some time to check for any
      changes you might want to add or remove. When you are satisfied with the
      website we will send it live for the whole world to see.
